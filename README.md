nw-jsf-showcase
===============

Showcase application integrating Spring 3.1 and JSF 2.0 on SAP's Netweaver 7.3 platform.


License disclaimer
------------------

This project was originally posted on SAP’s SDN Code Exchange platform. Recently SAP decided
to close down the platform and allowed the projects **not based on ABAP platform** to be hosted
elsewhere.

I release the code (Java) which was created by me to public domain, however some files
(JEE configuration files, for example) are obviously the property of SAP and are included here
only for demonstration purposes.
